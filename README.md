This program allows a Tiktok Live streamer to create a queue for their subscribers to join for the purposes of community events and streamer interactions.

After inputting the name of a streamer in the streamerName.txt file and launching the exe it will begin reading from that user's chat. 

Any subscribers to that live streamer can type !join in their chat to join the queue and !leave to leave. Be warned that using the !leave command will bar that user
from rejoining the queue until the queue is reset. This is to prevent users from gaming the system and leaving to just rejoin in order to participtate in an event multiple times.

The !remove #, !reset, and !list commands can be used by the channel's owner and any moderators of that channel. !remove # can be used to remove any number of user's from the front
of the queue after their turn is over. !list will display the current list. !reset will completely delete the list and allow any users that were previously on the old list to join
once again.
